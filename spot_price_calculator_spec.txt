# Spot Price Calculator Technical Specification

## Overview
The Spot Price Calculator is a feature that calculates the spot price of coins based on their metal content and current market prices. The calculator implements a "fixed dollar over spot" pricing model, which adds a fixed premium to the current spot price of the metal.

## Core Components

### 1. Data Model
- Coin Data Structure:
  - Basic Information:
    - ID
    - Barcode
    - Name
    - Quantity
  - Enriched Data:
    - Metal Content
    - Weight
    - Grade
    - Description
    - Price Guide Value
    - Certification Number

### 2. Price Calculation Logic
- Input Parameters:
  - Coin's metal content (e.g., gold, silver)
  - Coin's weight
  - Current spot price of metal
  - Fixed premium amount

- Calculation Formula:
  Spot Price = (Metal Weight Ã— Current Spot Price) + Fixed Premium

### 3. Integration Points
- PCGS API Integration:
  - Fetches coin metadata including metal content and weight
  - Retrieves current market data
  - Updates price guide values

- Product Database:
  - Stores coin specifications
  - Maintains pricing history
  - Tracks certification numbers
